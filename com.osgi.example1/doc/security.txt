Putting RSA and AES together
With every doubling of the RSA key length, decryption is 6-7 times times slower.
Hence, when there are large messages for RSA encryption, the performance degrades.
In such scenarios, we first do an AES encryption of the messages and the key used 
for AES encryption is RSA encrypted and sent to the server. 

This technique can be used by the Javascript or Android client for sending sensitive 
payloads to the server. We will demonstrate this in our next article of RSA encryption 
in javacript and decryption in Java.
